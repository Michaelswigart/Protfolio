# My bootstrap project

**Version 1.0.0**

     The version of bootstrap is 4.5 because 5.0 wasn't working right.

     The navbar is working as desired and the links work.  I have four images of me and my famly on my portfolio.
 
     The footer nav bar is working as disired and the link will take you to my facebook page.

     My bio is done as well and look's good with it's light blue background, orange navbar and my red footer navbar.
     
     The contact page is the same and the name, email and message box's are good but they don't send to my email.
