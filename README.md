# My bootstrap project

**Version 1.0.0**

     The version of bootstrap is 4.5 because 5.0 wasn't working right.

     The navbar is working as desired and the links work.  I have three images on my portfolio.
 
     The footer nav bar is working as disired and the link will take you to my facebook page.

     My bio is done as well and look's good.
     
     The contact page is the same and the name, email and message box's are good but they don't send to my email.
